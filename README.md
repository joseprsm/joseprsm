# Hi, I'm Jos√©!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about Digital Marketing, on a mission to bring Artificial Intelligence capabilities to Marketers everywhere. 

Since I've started my journey in Machine Learning, I've deployed hundreds of models on a number of platforms, all of which with a significant impact on conversion rates and operating costs. 

Right now, I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer, developing tools that guarantee that the Data Scientists' work actually sees the light of day. On my free time, I'm developing a couple of solutions that bring AI and Machine Learning closer to marketers and small business owners.

Love to be outdoors, old-school video-games, sci-fi films, coffee and spoiling my cats.
